Python part of remote controlling different antenna inputs for sdr receiver.
The python script will be started at boot of raspberry pi.
The pi has a connected OLED display to show the status of antenna switch, rx tx mode and the temperatur of the pi cpu.
SDR receiver is running in remote location connected to raspberry pi 4b. 
By use of an extra pcb is it possible to switch different antennas inputs. 
Additionally the sdr reciver input will be terminated with 50 ohm if the local ham radio is transmiting.
